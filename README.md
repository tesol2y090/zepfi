# ZepFi ‚Äî Cross-Chain TWAP Swaps with Best Execution

**ZepFi** is a decentralized intent-based trading engine that enables users to execute large token swaps across multiple blockchains using a **Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)** strategy. At every interval, ZepFi finds the **best price across chains like Ethereum, Polkadot (Moonbeam), NEAR, and Sui**, and executes the trade ‚Äî minimizing slippage, avoiding MEV, and maximizing execution efficiency.

Built on top of **1inch Fusion+**, ZepFi unifies cross-chain liquidity into a single intelligent trading flow.

## Features

- ‚è± **TWAP Execution**: Break down large swaps into timed intervals for better average pricing.
- üåâ **Cross-Chain Routing**: Bridge tokens and execute swaps across Ethereum, Moonbeam, NEAR, and Sui.
- üí∏ **Best Price Discovery**: Resolver scans liquidity sources across chains to find the most optimal swap path.
- üß† **Intent-Based Architecture**: Users sign intents off-chain; resolvers execute them on-chain.
- üìä **Visual Progress Dashboard**: Track each executed chunk and monitor TWAP performance.

## How It Works

1. User submits a TWAP swap (e.g., 10 ETH ‚Üí USDC over 5 rounds)

2. ZepFi signs 5 separate intents with timing and price constraints

3. At each interval:

   - Resolver fetches swap prices across all supported chains

   - Finds best execution path

   - Swaps and sends USDC to the user

4. Final report shows TWAP achieved vs market price
